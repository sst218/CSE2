//Roulette

//Uses a random number generator (recall Math.random()) to simulate this personâ€™s betting on 100 spins,
//but also runs the simulation 1000 times and collects data on the outcome
//Computes the number of times I lose everything (my number never comes up), 
//compute the total winnings (of all simulations added together), 
//and compute the number of times I walked away with a profit in one session of 100 spins of the wheel.
